This repository contains code for a project, where I was largely tasked with comparing multiple different text vectorisation methods, and fine tuning a BERT model to achieve an accuracy of 85%, 

Here is a concise walkthrough: 

1. Cleaned the dataset provided by the school for the project.
2. Appended my Resume to the dataset and underwent data cleaning for the updated dataset.
3. Proceeded on to attempt 4 different text vectorisation methods and compared them based on the cosine similarity of the other resumes to my resume (required by the school).
4. Then proceeded to fine tune BERT model, unappended my resume and split the dataset into train and val, letting the BERT model achieve a high enough accuracy. Used my resume as test data, where the model was able to correctly classify the category of
my resume.
